        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Tyler Shoemaker is a Postdoctoral Scholar affiliated with the <a
        href="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">DataLab</a> at the
        University of California, Davis. A digital humanist, he conducts
        research on language technology, focusing on how methods in natural
        language processing (NLP) crosscut the interpretive and theoretic
        frameworks of literary and media studies. At the DataLab, Tyler
        develops and implements NLP methods across a variety of research
        domains, ranging from early modern print to environmental and
        health sciences.</p>
